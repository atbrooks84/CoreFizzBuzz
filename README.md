# FizzBuzz MVC

Doing FizzBuzz in MVC with C#

## Purpose

The FizzBuzz exercise originally was a coding challenge to find multiples of 3 and 5 within a number range of 1 to 100. Each multiple of 3 would be replaced with "Fizz", each multiple of 5 would be replaced with "Buzz", and multiples of both (ie 15) would be replaced with "FizzBuzz". This has been further expanded to allow all initial values to be input by the user.
